# SMART-Visitor-Recognition-System
This project focuses on creating a smart visitor recognition system that provides notifications to the owner through the Internet whenever a person comes at the door. When a person comes at the door, camera sensor captures his/her image and sends it to the ML face recognition module. It recognises the face of the user with any of the allowed members and matches the entry timing. Furthermore, we have also provided a time-based heuristic which allows entry only under desired timings. The advantage gained by choosing this system over similar current systems is that it provides automatic entry in case the person is recognised and is trying to enter within desired timings. In all other cases, the user receives a notification to allow/deny. The developed system provides accurate judgements under different test scenarios. The time bound entry heuristic makes it unique when compared with similar systems developed so far.
